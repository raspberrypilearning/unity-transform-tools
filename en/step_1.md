The Transform tools allow you to move around in 3D space in the Scene view and change the position, rotation and scale of your game objects.

You can click on a tool to start using it, or use a keyboard shortcut:

+ Q, Hand - Pan around
+ W, Translate - Move a game object - drag the coloured arrows to move in X, Y, Z directions
+ E, Rotate - Rotate a game object - drag the coloured circles to rotate in X, Y, Z directions
+ R, Scale - Resize a game object - drag the coloured arrows to resize an object in X, Y, Z directions
+ T, Rect - Change a 2D object such as text

You can also change values in the Transform of a game object in the Inspector.

**Tip:** Sometimes it's easier to drag an object to roughly the right place using the Transform tools and then adjust the values to round numbers in the Transform for accurate positioning. 

**Tip:** The directions are coloured coded in the Scene view. X is Red, Y is Green (up and down) and Z is Blue.
